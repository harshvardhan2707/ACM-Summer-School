# Day 3 Overview
Fundamentals of Computational Physics:
There was a talk by Santosh Ansumali about Physics Assisted Digital Twins
- The talk mentioned the huge scope and requirement of High Performance computing in Physics simulations.
- The compute power required to provide organic results grows exponentially with linear increase in independent variables such as Reynolds number.

HPC in Physical Sciences:
- Numerical Methods
